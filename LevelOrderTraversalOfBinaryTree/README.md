Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree root, return the level order traversal of it as a nested list, where each sublist contains the values of nodes at a particular level in the tree, from left to right.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Output: [[1],[2,3],[4,5,6,7]]
Example 2:

Input: root = [1]

Output: [[1]]
Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: []
Constraints:

0 <= The number of nodes in both trees <= 1000.
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
