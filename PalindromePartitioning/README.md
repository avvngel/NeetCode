Palindrome Partitioning
Given a string s, split s into substrings where every substring is a palindrome. Return all possible lists of palindromic substrings.

You may return the solution in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aab"

Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
Example 2:

Input: s = "a"

Output: [["a"]]
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 20
s contains only lowercase English letters.
